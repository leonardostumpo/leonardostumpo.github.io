    abstract = { The conventional mix-cast-cure method for producing composite solid propellants faces two significant challenges: the use of toxic thermocuring additives and the necessity for a mandrel. The mandrel not only poses a risk of unintended ignition as a result of electrostatic charge buildup during removal but also restricts the potential geometries of the propellant grains. Recent research has aimed to address these issues through additive manufacturing technologies. This innovative method eliminates the need for a mandrel and uses photocurable propellants, which are less toxic and more suited for 3D printing. This article provides a comprehensive overview of seven years of research conducted collaboratively by Politecnico di Torino and Politecnico di Milano, detailing the advancements in developing a photocurable propellant and the corresponding 3D printing technology for its production. The resulting UV-curable propellant exhibits a rapid curing process, favorable rheological properties, and mechanical strength comparable to that of traditional propellants. X-ray tomography has confirmed satisfactory layer adhesion, and successful ballistic tests have been conducted. In addition, a prototype 3D printer has been developed, with initial printing tests currently in progress. }

    abstract = { Hybrid Rocket Engines have gained more and more attention in recent years due to their appealing safety and cost-effectiveness features, but they present some disadvantages, most notably a low regression rate. Swirl injection offers a promising solution, enhancing regression rate and stabilizing combustion by means of increased wall heat flux. This paper introduces a novel swirl model for regression rate evaluation consisting in two integrated sub-models: the first one involves a corrective factor linked to the geometric swirl number of the injector, while the other accounts for the naturally occurring swirl decay. The validity of the model was assessed across a range of different test cases, varying geometric parameters, engine scales, injection, and feeding conditions, and the results shows that the accuracy of local and mean regression rate prediction is improved. Corrections for the wall friction coefficient and the entrainment factor were introduced in an in-house code for paraffin-based fuels. A parametric analysis, carried out considering different swirl levels, revealed combustion chamber thermodynamics consistent with the expected trends observed in firing tests. Finally, an effective reduction in the delay time characteristic of the boundary layer was observed; moreover, the Rayleigh index results showed a marked decrease, indicating a decoupling of pressure fluctuations and heat release which tends to stabilize combustion as the swirl increases. }

ABSTRACT = {This study delves into the rheological and mechanical properties of a 3D-printable composite solid propellant with 80% wt solids loading. Polybutadiene is used as a binder with ammonium sulfate, which is added as an inert replacement for the ammonium perchlorate oxidizer. Further additives are introduced to allow for UV curing. An in-house illumination system made of four UV-A LEDs (385 nm) is employed to cure the resulting slurry. Rheological and mechanical tests are conducted to evaluate the viscosity, ultimate tensile strength and strain, and compression behavior. Viscosity tests are performed for both pure resin and complete propellant composition. A viscosity reduction factor is obtained for the tested formulations when pre-heating slurry. Uniaxial tensile and compression tests reveal that the mechanical properties are consistent with previous research. Results emphasize the critical role of temperature and solid loading percentage. Pre-heating resin composites may grant a proper viscosity reduction while keeping mechanical properties in the applicability range. Overall, these findings pave the way for the development of a 3D printer prototype for composite solid propellants.},
