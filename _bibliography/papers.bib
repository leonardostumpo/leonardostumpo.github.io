ABSTRACT = {This study delves into the rheological and mechanical properties of a 3D-printable composite solid propellant with 80% wt solids loading. Polybutadiene is used as a binder with ammonium sulfate, which is added as an inert replacement for the ammonium perchlorate oxidizer. Further additives are introduced to allow for UV curing. An in-house illumination system made of four UV-A LEDs (385 nm) is employed to cure the resulting slurry. Rheological and mechanical tests are conducted to evaluate the viscosity, ultimate tensile strength and strain, and compression behavior. Viscosity tests are performed for both pure resin and complete propellant composition. A viscosity reduction factor is obtained for the tested formulations when pre-heating slurry. Uniaxial tensile and compression tests reveal that the mechanical properties are consistent with previous research. Results emphasize the critical role of temperature and solid loading percentage. Pre-heating resin composites may grant a proper viscosity reduction while keeping mechanical properties in the applicability range. Overall, these findings pave the way for the development of a 3D printer prototype for composite solid propellants.},

    abstract = { The conventional mix-cast-cure method for producing composite solid propellants faces two significant challenges: the use of toxic thermocuring additives and the necessity for a mandrel. The mandrel not only poses a risk of unintended ignition as a result of electrostatic charge buildup during removal but also restricts the potential geometries of the propellant grains. Recent research has aimed to address these issues through additive manufacturing technologies. This innovative method eliminates the need for a mandrel and uses photocurable propellants, which are less toxic and more suited for 3D printing. This article provides a comprehensive overview of seven years of research conducted collaboratively by Politecnico di Torino and Politecnico di Milano, detailing the advancements in developing a photocurable propellant and the corresponding 3D printing technology for its production. The resulting UV-curable propellant exhibits a rapid curing process, favorable rheological properties, and mechanical strength comparable to that of traditional propellants. X-ray tomography has confirmed satisfactory layer adhesion, and successful ballistic tests have been conducted. In addition, a prototype 3D printer has been developed, with initial printing tests currently in progress. }
